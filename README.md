<b>Semantic-Analyser-Subpart | Language Processors | Basic Version</b><br />
<u>Problem Statement:</u><br />
New declarations don't conflict with earlier ones<br /><br />
<u>Assumptions:</u><br />
Assume that you have only one function main() and there are no global variables.<br />
Assume you have only assignment statements of the form "a=b" and "a=b+c"<br />
Assume that you have only if-statement and if-else-statement - no loops and switch.<br /><br />
<u>Note:</u><br />
Currently, the analyser supports int and char datatype only. It treats all other datatypes as OTHER.<br />
